    "\n",
    "Quantization is a deep learning model optimization technique that is used to improve the speed of inference. It reduces the number of bits required by converting a set of real-valued numbers into a lower bit data representation such as int8 and int4. This helps in reducing the memory requirement, cache miss rate, and computational cost of using neural networks, and also in achieving the goal of higher inference performance.\n",
