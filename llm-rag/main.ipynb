    "# PDF Interaction with Hybrid Retrievals 📄🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the future of document interaction! Whether you're a student, researcher, developer, or simply someone who works with PDFs, this guide will show you how to make the most of advanced retrieval techniques to chat with your PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wished you could ask questions about a PDF document and get quick, relevant answers? With **Hybrid Retrievals**, **Conceptualization**, **Reranking**, and **Contextual Compression**, you can enhance your PDF experience like never before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your PDF, and the system will analyze the content using both traditional keyword search and advanced machine learning models. This hybrid approach allows you to query the document, extract information, and even have a back-and-forth conversation about its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is powered by cutting-edge AI technology, ensuring high-quality results and accurate, context-aware responses. No complex setup, just easy interaction with your documents in real time.\n",

    "## Hybrid Retriever Setup 🔍\n",
    "In this section, we set up a hybrid retriever that combines multiple retrieval methods to answer user queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DB Retriever**: \n",
    "    - Uses the Chroma vector database (`db`) for efficient vector-based retrieval, leveraging the embeddings stored in the database for document search.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **BM25 Retriever**:\n",
    "    - A classical information retrieval technique based on the BM25 algorithm, which ranks documents according to their relevance to the query. The `k=5` limits the number of retrieved documents to 5.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Contextual Compression Retriever**:\n",
    "    - The **Contextual Compression Retriever** is an advanced retrieval technique that combines the power of deep learning models with traditional retrieval methods. It works by first retrieving documents using an initial retrieval method (e.g., BM25 or Chroma database). \n",
    "    - **Purpose**: The primary goal of the Contextual Compression Retriever is to enhance the relevance of the returned documents by considering the **context of the query**. This is crucial in handling complex queries where context and intent are more important than just keyword matches. By reranking, it selects the most relevant documents that best align with the user's intent and query context.\n",
    "    - **Key Feature**: The model chooses the **top 3 documents** after reranking, ensuring that the most relevant results are provided to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reranking**:\n",
    "    - **Reranking** refers to the process where the documents retrieved by an initial retrieval method (e.g., BM25) are passed through a more sophisticated model to score and reorder them. This step helps refine the relevance of the documents by considering not only keyword matches but also the semantic context of both the query and the documents.\n",
    "    - **How It Works**: The reranking model (e.g., `BAAI/bge-reranker-base`) processes the query and documents through a transformer-based model that understands deeper semantic relationships. It evaluates how well each document answers the user's question in the given context and reorders them accordingly. The final ranking reflects the documents that are the most relevant based on the **contextual meaning** of the query, rather than just matching keywords.\n",
    "    - **Purpose**: The goal of reranking is to improve the quality of the retrieved documents by applying a more **context-aware model** that ensures the documents returned are not only relevant based on keywords but also semantically aligned with the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Retriever**:\n",
    "    - Combines the BM25 and Contextual Compression Retrievers into an ensemble. The retrievers contribute proportionally to the final results (weights=[0.7, 0.3]), enabling the hybrid retriever to leverage both classical and modern retrieval methods. This balance ensures that the system delivers comprehensive document coverage while maintaining contextual accuracy in its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "The ensemble retriever returns the most relevant documents by leveraging both traditional and advanced retrieval methods, combining the strengths of keyword-based ranking (BM25) and context-aware reranking. Reranking ensures that the documents returned are not only relevant based on keywords but also semantically aligned with the user's query, leading to more precise and contextually appropriate results.\n"

    "There are a few limitations that users may encounter when using the assistant. These limitations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Token Length**: The \"MAX_LENGTH\" parameter in the code represents the maximum token limit supported by the model (NousResearch-llama-2-7b-chat-hf). As a result, the assistant can process only 3-4 queries at a time. This is because the model needs to load all the retrieved content, history, and corpus into memory, which limits the number of queries it can handle effectively. If you need to process more queries or handle larger content, consider using a model with larger parameters. A bigger model supports a higher token length, allowing it to manage more queries at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hallucination**: Occasionally, the assistant may respond with \"I don't know\" even when the question is derived from the corpus. This could happen if the model cannot find the relevant information within the given context. To resolve this issue, try restarting the kernel and re-submit your queries. This helps refresh the model's context and can improve the accuracy of its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Out of Memory**: If you encounter an \"Out of Memory\" error, it means the token limit of the model has been exceeded, and there are insufficient resources left to generate a response. In this case, try restarting the kernel and re-submit your queries. If this problem persists, using a model with more parameters may allow for better memory handling and support for longer queries.\n"
